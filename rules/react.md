# React
We use React 19 (no forwardRef - `ref` is passed as prop, no `useCallback` needed).

CRITICAL: Never mention or use `forwardRef`, or `useCallback`.

## Do and Not Do Section
### NEVER:
- Use forwardRef or useCallback (React 19 doesn't need them)

### ALWAYS:
- Research with MCP Exa Docs and Context7 for React 19 features
